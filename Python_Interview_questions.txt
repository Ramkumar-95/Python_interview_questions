1.Empty list in python is made by ?

l=[]

l=list()

2.How we can convert the given list into the set ?

set(list)

3.If we change one data type to another, then it is called as 

Type conversion/Type casting

4.In which data type, indexing is not valid =>Dictionary,set

5.In which data type, duplicate items are not allowed =>set

6.what are immutable and mutable data types in python?

Immutable-int,float,str,bool,complex,bytes,tuple
Mutable-list,bytearray,set,dictionary

7. What are membership operators? 

	Membership operators are used to compare the content whixh is been present or not by using in and not in.
	ex:
	"A" in "Ram"==>False
	"a" in "Ram"==>True
	"A" not in "Ram"==>True

8.Explain identity operators in Python?
	Identity operators are used to check whether two values are been having same identity

	10 is "10"==>False

9.What is a function?

	When we want to execute a sequence of statements, we can give it a name and we can call the function whenever we want to execute.

10.What is Python's parameter passing mechanism?
	There are two parameters passing mechanism in Python:

	Pass by references
	Pass by value

11 - Which conditional statements are available in Python ?
	Conditional statements are the programming statements which alter the course of execution based on a condition.
	if
	if-else
	elif

12 - Which looping statements are available in Python ?
	Looping statements are those which repeat the execution of a set of statements in a cyclic manner based on a condition.
	for
	while
13.What is lambda function in python?
	lambda is a keyword in python which creates an anonymous function. Lambda does not contain block of statements. It does not contain return statements.	

14.What is Scope in Python?
	Every object in Python functions within a scope. A scope is a block of code where an object in Python remains relevant. Namespaces uniquely identify all the objects inside a program. However, these namespaces also have a scope defined for them where you could use their objects without any prefix. A few examples of scope created during code execution in Python are as follows:

A local scope refers to the local objects available in the current function.
A global scope refers to the objects available throught the code execution since their inception.

15.What is break, continue and pass in Python?
	Break=>	The break statement terminates the loop immediately
		and the control flows to the statement after the body of the loop.
	Continue=>The continue statement terminates the current iteration of the statement,
		skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and the control flows to the next iteration of the loop.
	Pass=> As explained above, pass keyword in Python is generally used to fill-up empty blocks
		and is similar to an empty statement represented by a semi-colon in languages such as Java, C++, Javascript etc.
